React Js 

*ReactJS is an open-source JavaScript library used to create user interfaces in a declarative and efficient way.

*Document Object Model (DOM) is an application programming interface(API) for HTML and XML documents.

*It defines the logical structure of documents and how a document is accessed and manipulated). 

*To make it faster, React implements a virtual DOM which is basically a DOM tree representation in JavaScript, and React was invented.

*React creates a virtual DOM in memory to update the browser’s DOM.

*The virtual DOM will try to find the most efficient way to update the browser’s DOM.

*React DOM takes care of updating the DOM to match the React elements. 

*JSX stands for JavaScript XML.

*JSX is basically a syntax extension of JavaScript.

*Using JSX is not compulsory but it is highly recommended for programming in React as it makes the development process easier as the code becomes easy to write and read. 

*JSX creates an element in React that gets rendered in the UI.


*It is transformed into JavaScript functions by the compiler at runtime. 

*Error handling and warnings become easier to handle when using JSX

*const ele = <h1>This is sample JSX</h1>;

*It is faster than normal JavaScript as it performs optimizations while translating to regular JavaScript.

*It makes it easier for us to create templates.

*As JSX is an expression, we can use it inside of if statements and for loops, assign it to variables, accept it as arguments, or return it from functions.
